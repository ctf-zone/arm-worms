# Intro

This is a game in which computers fight each other to infect as many nodes on the network as possible and score points for mining.

At the beginning of the game, each team is provided with a computer (node) on which the team runs its shellcode. The initial position of each command is determined randomly among all computers with x86 architecture.

All computers execute one instruction per turn. The order of moves is randomly determined each round. The total time allocated to the round is 2 minutes.
The total number of instructions that can be executed on one computer is `2**17`.

# Installation for local tests

Installation steps:

* `git clone https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn.git`
* `git clone https://github.com/aquynh/capstone.git`
* `docker-compose up --build`

After installation, check the following URLs:

* `http://0.0.0.0:5000/test`
* `http://0.0.0.0:5000/test_all`

# Map

There are 2 types of network in which computers are located: a 121-node grid and a 121-node ternary tree. At the beginning of each round, the network is randomly selected.
Each node has its own ID.

In the case of the ternary tree:

* the central node has identifier `0`
* neighbors of the central node have identifiers `1`, `2`, `3`
* etc

In the case of the grid:

* node `(0, 0)` has identifier `0`
* node `(0, 1)` has identifier `1`
* node `(0, 2)` has identifier `2`
* etc

# Architecture

Each node is a computer with a specific type of architecture and scoring model:

* x86
    - X86 architecture
    - extreme nodes for ternary tree and perimeter nodes for the grid
    - 1 point for mining
    - at startup all commands have this architecture
* arm
    - ARM architecture
    - all internal nodes except the center
    - 2 points for mining
* super
    - ARM architecture
    - central node
    - 4 points for mining

# Computer memory

Each computer has the following memory structure:

| start  | end    | memory |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 0x0000 | 0x03ff | code   |
| 0x0400 | 0x07ff | stack  |
| 0x0800 | 0x0fff | data   |

Each team can execute shellcode 512 bytes long.
Shellcode starts its execution from address 0x0000.

# Rules

The goal of the team is to mine as many points as possible per round.
In order to get points for mining, you must perform the following steps:

* get new crc16 value with `SYS_GET_CRC16`
* find the inverse value to the received crc16
* send `crc16_inv` with `SYS_SEND_CRC16`

In order to infect neighbour computer, you must perform the following steps:

* get new crc16 value with `SYS_GET_CRC16`
* find the inverse value to the received crc16
* infect a neighbor using its identifier and `crc16_inv` value with `SYS_INFECT`
